# Rust-CS330
This repo is for learning Rust in Programming Languages - CS330 at Simmons University.
Author: Paige Thompson

## Language overview and setup
Rust is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that enforces statically typed variables and memory safety. 
### History
[1] Rust was named after an incredibly hardy fungus, the Rust fungus, after being created by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. It began as a personal project and became sponsored by Mozilla in 2009 as part of Mozilla's 2010 browser engine, Servo. [2] Servo became the browser engine for two Mozilla projects, the augmented reality browser for the Magic Leap headset in 2018 and then the FireFox reality headset released two years later.

By October 2012, Rust had classes, destructors, polymorphism, inheritance, and structured types. Memory management was also improved shortly after. The first stable release, Rust 1.0, was released in 2015. 

### Getting started
